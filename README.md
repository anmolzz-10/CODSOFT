## Task 2: Image Captioning

### Description:
In this task, I combined computer vision and natural language processing to build an AI that generates captions for images. The project utilizes pre-trained image recognition models like Inceptionv3 to extract features from images and an Transformer based model to generate descriptive captions.

### Objectives:
- Explore the integration of computer vision and NLP.
- Use pre-trained models for feature extraction.
- Implement an RNN-based model for generating image captions.

### Files:
- `image_captioning.py`: Contains the implementation of the image captioning model.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
